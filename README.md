# React Hooks Global-State Boilerplate
React-Express boilerplate using global state store with hooks

Includes some components to render an initial todo list that uses state the same way Redux would :)

Remove both the components and reducer's switch cases to make a clean boilerplate for development.

Fork and modify as needed.

Use `npm run dev` to start.
